They are Australia, Brazil, Canada, France and Netherlands. Vintage rallying involves recreational car rally events held on sealed roads open to the public. The emphasis is on using navigational skills to follow route instructions.</p>
            
            <p class="P-Home"> Any vehicle that is road registered and has at least two seats is eligible to enter events.</p>
            
            <p class="P-Home"> On our website you can see all about classic rallying, see what rallies are drives and a co-driver who assists the driver. Co-drivers play an important role such as navigating or time management in a competition, so that drivers can concentrate on driving.

            <h3>When does a car become a classic?</h3>
            <p>It's a simple question: When does a car become a classic?<br>
            The answer, though, is not quite so easy to answer. A classic car, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder.</p>

                        The car was designed by Gerald Palmer during World War II and was intended to be a major leap forward from the relatively staid designs of pre-war Jowetts.
