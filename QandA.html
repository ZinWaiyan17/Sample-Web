                    &emsp;&emsp;A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. 
                    Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification criteria vary, but consensus within any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the UK.

                    &emsp;&emsp;There's more than one definition of “classic car,” and they can differ greatly. 
                    For example, the Classic Car Club of America defines a classic as a “fine” or “distinctive” automobile built between 1915 and 1948. 
                    However, for registration purposes, many states would consider cars of that age to be antique or vintage automobiles.
                    For insurance and registration purposes, the age of a classic car, in most cases, is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old. 
                    If you are going to register it (and insure it) as a classic, it should have been kept to its original design and specifications. 
                    That means any restoration must remain consistent with the way the car was originally built, including the kinds of materials used in the interior and the kind of parts used in the engine. It also means no modern touches can be added; For example, an MP3 player or a built-in GPS navigator in a 1988 Mustang is a no-go.

                    &emsp;&emsp;There is a lot of confusion on what exactly a classic car is, and what sets it apart from vintage and antique cars. 
                    We have heard the term "classic" used interchangeably when describing any old car that looks as if doesn't belong on the roads with the modern daily drivers.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Usually, the classic car moniker applies to vehicles over 20 years old. 
                    Antique cars are over 45 years old, and vintage cars are built between 1919 and 1930. 
                    But as with many subjects in the motoring world, not everyone can agree on a single definition. 
                    State DMVs, insurance companies, and classic car clubs classify each one differently. 
                    And some classifications overlap between classics and antiques.
