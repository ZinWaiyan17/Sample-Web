            &emsp;&emsp;Vintage and historic cars evoke enthusiasm and spark a passion; and since 1934 the Vintage Rally Club has provided an arena for people to enjoy pre-war cars competitively and socially.
            Active in every aspect of motoring and motorsport for pre-war cars, the Vintage Rally Car is one of the largest and best regarded motoring clubs in the world. 
            With such a diverse range of motoring disciplines on offer there is plenty of scope to become involved, whether as a car owner, marshal, competitor or enthusiast.
